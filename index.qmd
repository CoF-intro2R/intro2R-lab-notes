This site hosts lab materials for an introductory R course I designed for incoming graduate students in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. Feel free to use any of the material that suits your educational needs.

For more information on my teaching, research, and consulting, check out my [website](https://dusty-gannon.github.io/).
